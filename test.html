        Robert John Downey Jr. (born April 4, 1965)[1] is an American actor. His career has been characterized by critical success in his youth, followed by a period of substance abuse and legal troubles, and a surge in popular and commercial success later in his career. His films as a leading actor have grossed over $14 billion worldwide, making him one of the highest-grossing actors of all time.[2] In 2008, Downey was named by Time magazine among the 100 most influential people in the world, and from 2013 to 2015, he was listed by Forbes as Hollywood's highest-paid actor.[3][4]
